## Projects Overview

I have worked on projects utilizing **Northwind** and **World** databases to build practical SQL and data analysis solutions:

### Northwind Database Projects
- Explored a classic sales database to analyze customer orders, product trends, and employee performance.
- Developed queries to extract insights on sales patterns, top-selling products, and order histories.

### World Database Projects
- Worked with global geographic and population data to perform country- and continent-level analyses.
- Created queries to analyze population distribution, country statistics, and regional comparisons.

These projects demonstrate my ability to work with relational databases, write complex SQL queries, and extract meaningful insights from structured data.
